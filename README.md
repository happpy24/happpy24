## Some facts about me!
- I am 19 years of age.
- I like osu! and it has helped me learn graphic design.
- I am obsessed with hatsune miku

## I do Graphic Design & Game Development, next up for my projects:
- Designs for next iterations for National Dutch Championship 2025 (NDC), Cavoes osu! event 2025 (COE), 5 Digit World Cup 2025 (5WC), all of which are osu! related. 
- I'm currently working on a Party Game like Mario party/wii party island. The idea is that you can use your phone as controller (which we got working already). For this project I am project lead.
